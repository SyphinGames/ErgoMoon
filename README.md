# ErgoMoon
The newest iteration of my keyboard design. 
I love the Keyboard idustry but with large boards taking them in your backpack or brief case isn't always the easiest. 
My design is meant for those that want a portable board that does almost everything. with every iteration the design should get better looking and more slimed. I am also new to this doesn't mean that I can't keep working on this design. I aprecciate the support any new support would be awesome Enjoy the ergo and enjoy the board.
